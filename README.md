##Autonomous Emergency Responders
Objective: We aimed to design and build the next generation of emergency responders. Our system will be dispatched from the station to the accident or rendezvous location, secure and retrieve the injured person, and transport back to the hospital. The road conditions for the transport (ambulance) will be hard, relatively smooth. However, the injured person may be in a different   terrain. Our solution would need the following required capabilities:
1. Navigating the city roads between designated locations and without any collisions
2. Safely and securely pickup and transport the victim.
