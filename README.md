## Autonomous Emergency Responders
### Objective: 
We aimed to design and build the next generation of emergency responders. Our system will be dispatched from the station to the accident or rendezvous location, secure and retrieve the injured person, and transport back to the hospital. The road conditions for the transport (ambulance) will be hard, relatively smooth. However, the injured person may be in a different   terrain. Our solution would need the following required capabilities:
1. Navigating the city roads between designated locations and without any collisions
2. Safely and securely pickup and transport the victim. 

### Our Solution:
We opted for a two system solution comprising of :
1. Ambulance - mobile robot that would traverse the "city" roads, avoiding potential traffic or road blockages as necessary, and offer a cradle to carry the victim to the hospital
2. Crane - fixed robot mounted to cliff that will locate victim, secure the strechter with the victim, and transfer the load to the waiting ambulance
